- **Container Support**: Docker-based development environment for consistency
- **Scalability**: Modular design allows for easy addition of new components

### 🔧 Migration Guide
If you were using the previous version:
1. **Backup your configurations**: Any custom configs should be backed up
2. **Run the new setup**: Use `./setup/complete_setup.sh` for fresh installation
3. **Update your workflows**: Check new Docker Compose services
4. **Review documentation**: New docs are in `docs/` directory

### 📝 Breaking Changes
- **Directory structure changed**: Some files moved to new locations
- **Setup process changed**: New unified setup script replaces individual scripts
- **Configuration format**: Some config files updated for better organization
