1. Update your package lists:
```bash
sudo apt update
```

2. Install ZSH:
```bash
sudo apt install zsh
```

3. Verify the installation:
```bash
zsh --version
```

4. Set ZSH as your default shell (optional):
```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

5. Log out and log back in for the change to take effect.

When you first start ZSH, you'll see a configuration wizard. You can choose option 2 for a basic configuration or install Oh My ZSH for enhanced features.

Would you like me to explain any of these steps in more detail?
