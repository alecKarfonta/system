# Using Conda Virtual Environments

Virtual environments in Conda allow you to create isolated Python environments with specific packages and versions. Here's a comprehensive guide to working with Conda environments:

## Basic Commands

### Creating Environments

```bash
# Create a new environment with the latest Python version
conda create --name myenv

# Create with specific Python version
conda create --name myenv python=3.10

# Create with specific packages
conda create --name myenv python=3.10 pandas numpy matplotlib
```

### Activating/Deactivating Environments

```bash
# Activate an environment
conda activate myenv

# Deactivate current environment (return to base)
conda deactivate
```

### Managing Environments

```bash
# List all environments
conda env list

# Remove an environment
conda env remove --name myenv

# Clone an existing environment
conda create --name mynewenv --clone myoldenv
```

## Package Management

```bash
# Install packages in active environment
conda install package_name

# Install specific version
conda install package_name=1.2.3

# Install multiple packages
conda install package1 package2

# Install from specific channel
conda install -c conda-forge package_name

# Update all packages
conda update --all

# Update specific package
conda update package_name

# List installed packages
conda list

# Search for available packages
conda search package_name
```

## Environment Files

```bash
# Export environment to file
conda env export > environment.yml

# Create environment from file
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Working with Pip in Conda

Sometimes you'll need packages from PyPI that aren't available in Conda:

```bash
# Activate your environment first
conda activate myenv

# Then use pip
pip install package_name
```

## Best Practices

1. **Create specific environments** for different projects
2. **Document your environment** with environment files
3. **Use conda-forge channel** for additional packages
4. **Install pip packages only after conda packages** to avoid dependency conflicts
5. **Name environments meaningfully** related to your projects
